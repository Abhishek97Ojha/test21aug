window.onload :- 
•By default, it is fired when the entire page loads, including its content (images, CSS, scripts, etc.).
•In some browsers it now takes over the role of document.onload and fires when the DOM is ready as well.

document.onload :-
•It is called when the DOM is ready which can be prior to images and other external content is loaded.


→ The general idea is that window.onload fires when the document's window is ready for presentation 
and 
→ document.onload fires when the DOM tree (built from the markup code within the document) is completed.
→ window.onload appears to be the most widely supported. In fact, some of the most modern browsers have in a sense replaced document.onload with window.onload.
